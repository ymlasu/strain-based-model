# Strain-based-model

The proposed strain-based model which apply characteristic plane approach predict fatigue life under constant loading. The code is suitable for different materials, however, the code only includes one material. Once the material properties and loading data, the code can calculate different material fatigue life.

The code is proposed under "Strain-based multiaxial fatigue damage modelling". All the detail in the code can be found in this paper.
